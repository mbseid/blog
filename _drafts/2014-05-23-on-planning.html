<p>As I'm starting to find out, while working on a new company planning is not only hard but also may seem futile. With your surroundings constantly changing it's hard to gauge where the destination point is, or &nbsp;where the desired destination is. At times you'll be tempted to detour to some close islands, but you must make sure not get distract from your main destination. In the lady week, I have learned a lot about planning, both in my business and my personal life. It's a balance, but while running your own company the lines tend to blur. I have found it's important to keep both plans separate, but also embrace when they do entangle! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Make sure you have your three and six months goal in mind.  </p>
<p>Communicate and make sure your plans are explicitly discussed.</p>
<p>Embrace when things change.</p>
<p>Be the pilot, don't ride the rollar coaster</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>but planning both is important.&nbsp;</p>
