Hi Folks!

It's been a long time, and sorry for the delay. I have been working hard on my startup Naytev and we have been growing a lot. There have been a lot of up and downs, but we are really hitting our stride and expanding our verticles.

Not only are we optimizing content for social media, we are also helping brands get more visibility through sponsored content. 

You should check out <a href="https://www.naytev.com" class="naytev-sponsored-link">Naytev</a> for more information.
