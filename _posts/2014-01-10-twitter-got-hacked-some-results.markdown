In a wild flurry, my twitter account got hacked today at 3:35pm. I was in a meeting, didn't click any messages or links, and out of nowhere, I got a flurry of interactions on my phone. When I checked, I immediately knew what was going on and changed my password. It seemed to stop as soon soon as I changed my password.

After that, it was time to clean up my mess, apologize to people I disturbed and make sure it won't happen again.

**Some results:**

*   1 SPAM tweet
*   250+ direct messages sent
*   187 new people followed
*   25 (and counting ) people let me know I was hacked
*   1 Lesson learned about security

In light of the recent hacks of Adobe, Yahoo, Snapchat, and Target, I should have been better of my security. This relatively harmless attack has really gotten me aware of my account security. If there had to be a bright side, it could have been worse and I caught up with some people who I haven't talked to in a while.
