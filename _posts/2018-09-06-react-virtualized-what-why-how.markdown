### React Virtualized: What Why and How

This talk was given at the [ReactNYC meetup in New York on September 6th, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/ReactNYC/events/253646503/).

**Description:**

When building data intensive applications, a simple large list can crash chrome. Using the browser virtualization method, we can make components that efficiently render large lists and tabular data by only actually rendering elements that are present in the viewing window. React Virtualized is a fantastic library that makes browser virtualization easy and "reacty". We will go over what the virtualization method is, why you would use it and how to use React Virtualized.
