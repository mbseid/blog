To kick off 2014 and start on my adventure of improving my brand, the first thing I have to do is to unify it.

Take a second to think about what Web Platforms you have an account on. You'll first list off the usual suspects, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. Thats what I did, after looking around a bit more, I found a ton of places where I had published my Persona. Some of these I haven't touched in years, others I never even filled in. All shared my brand, what I do.

#### Platforms I am on:

*   Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/mbseid)
*   Twitter (https://twitter.com/mbseid)
*   LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-seid/19/176/a8b/)
*   Google + (https://plus.google.com/+MichaelSeid/)
*   About.me (http://about.me/mbseid)
*   Tumblr (http://mbseid.tumblr.com/)
*   mbseid.com ( here )
*   Meetup (By group but example here: http://www.meetup.com/nescala/members/37854792/)
*   Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/mbseid)

Among others. I will keep this list up to date as I find more. It was shocking to see how many I had, and what was public. Even some such as Facebook shared a lot more than I would expect.

The process of unification comes in two steps:  
 1\. Create the content that exemplifies your persona.  
 2\. Populate the content into all of the social networks, making tweaks when appropriate.

I am going to be writing content in my next post. Stay Tuned.
